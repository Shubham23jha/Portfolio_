    "title": "Learning Management System",
    "description": "I developed a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) from scratch using modern web technologies such as React.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Axios, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The system includes secure user authentication for sign-up and login, and features role-based dashboards tailored for admins and students. Admins can upload and manage courses, while students can self-enroll in courses. Additionally, the LMS integrates admin tools for monitoring student registrations and course popularity. For payment processing, I utilized Razor Pay to ensure secure and efficient transactions.",
